title: Birth time of a file on GNU Linux distributions
tags: software-archeology, BSD, GNU, coreutils, Linux, Unix, translated

Have you ever wondered why it is that on GNU/Linux distributions
[`stat(1)`](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/stat.1.html) command from [GNU
Coreutils](https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/) reports 3 classic unix time
stamps *access*, *modify* and *change* and on top of that, there is also
something called *birth*, but without any value? Why is the empty birth field
even there?
I became interested in this less known timestamp few months ago while I was
debugging a rare problem, trying to get as much additional evidence as
possible. And even though it didn't help me in the end, I gradually learned a
bit about it's history and it's future. Hence this post lies somewhere between
software archeology and Linux Weekly News, and here you will
learn where the timestamp comes from, how to work with it in GNU/Linux
distributions and what it's future looks like.

Let's start with an example so that we get a better idea what I'm writing about
here. The following output shows stat executed on a file stored on ext4
filesystem. It was done Fedora 29 with GNU Coreutils 8.30 and Linux
kernel 4.19.8:

```
$ stat public_html
  File: public_html
  Size: 4096      	Blocks: 8          IO Block: 4096   directory

## Unix File Timestamps

Unix file timestamps, as returned by [stat
syscall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stat_(system_call)), are defined in
[POSIX](http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/sys_stat.h.html)
standard in the following way:

Timestamp      Field in `struct stat`   Meaning
-------------  -----------------------  ------------------------------------
access         `st_atim`                last data access
modify         `st_mtim`                last data modification
change         `st_ctim`                last file status (inode) change

Originally, timestamp fields in in the `stat` structure stored time with second
precision and ended with `e` (eg. `st_atime` for *access time*). Later
these timestamps were extended to handle nanosecond resolution, and new naming
scheme without last `e` was chosen for compatibility reasons.
Linux implements nanosecond resolution for these timestamp fields since 2.5.48,
see [`stat(2)`](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/stat.2.html).
From now on I'm just going to refer to *access time* as *atime*, to *modify
time* as *mtime* and so on regardless of the difference in resolution between
`st_atim` and `st_atime`.

Important (and for this blog post the most striking) detail is that there is no
file creation timestamp in POSIX standard.

That said if people unfamiliar with Unix systems look briefly at sheer
timestamp field names in `stat` structure (see the table above), they may
conclude that ctime likely stands for *creation time* and thus consider file
creation or birth time as supported.
Further reading in related man pages will quickly show that such conclusion is
incorrect though.
Likewise if you read paper [The UNIX Time-Sharing
System](https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/dmr/www/cacm.html) from 1973 authored by
Unix creators today, you may believe that ctime originally meant creation
time and that it's purpose changed over time, since creation timestamp is
directly mentioned there:

> The entry found thereby (the file's i-node) contains the description of the
> file:
> ...
> time of creation, last use, and last modification

Nevertheless [as clarified on
wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Stat_(system_call)&oldid=872237631#ctime), that would be another misunderstanding.
Few early versions of [Research
Unix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_Unix) actually supported a
creation timestamp, as we can see eg. in
[`stat(2)` man page of version 3](https://github.com/dspinellis/unix-history-repo/blob/Research-V3-Snapshot-Development/man/man2/stat.2)
from February 1973:

```
NAME            stat  --  get file status

SYNOPSIS        sys stat; name; buf  / stat = 18.

DESCRIPTION     name  points to a null-terminated string naming a
file; buf is the address of a 34(10) byte buffer into  which  in-
formation  is  placed  concerning the file.  It is unnecessary to
have any permissions at all with respect to the file, but all di-
rectories leading to the file must be readable.

After stat, buf has the following format:

buf, +1         i-number
+2,+3           flags (see below)
+4              number of links
+5              user ID of owner
+6,+7           size in bytes
+8,+9           first indirect block or contents block
+22,+23         eighth indirect block or contents block
+24,+25,+26,+27 creation time
+28,+29,+30,+31 modification time
+32,+33         unused
```

Btw another interesting thing is that `stat` command from this version doesn't
include *creation time* in it's output, at least based on
[`stat(1)` man page](https://github.com/dspinellis/unix-history-repo/blob/Research-V3-Snapshot-Development/man/man1/stat.1)
(I wasn't able to find it's source code):

```
NAME            stat  --  get file status

SYNOPSIS        stat name1 ...

DESCRIPTION     stat gives several kinds of information about one
or more files:

   i-number
   access mode
   number of links
   owner
   size in bytes
   date and time of last modification
   name (useful when several files are named)
```

But right in the following release of Research Unix, which was version 4 from
November 1973, there is no creation timestamp anymore.
It's worth noting that V4 was first Unix version written in c.
And thanks to that, fields in stat structure were given their names, which
differs a bit compared to the names used today.
See [`stat(2)` manpage from
V4](https://github.com/dspinellis/unix-history-repo/blob/Research-V4-Snapshot-Development/man/man2/stat.2):

```
stat  get file status (stat = 18.)
sys stat; name; buf stat(name, buf)
char *name;
struct  inode  *buf;  points to a null-terminated string naming a
file; is the address of a 36(10) byte buffer into which  informa-
tion  is  placed  concerning the file.  It is unnecessary to have
any permissions at all with respect to the file, but all directo-
ries leading to the file must be readable.  After has the follow-
ing structure (starting offset given in bytes):
struct {
   char  minor;         /* +0: minor device of i-node */
   char  major;         /* +1: major device */
   int   inumber        /* +2 */
   int   flags;         /* +4: see below */
   char  nlinks;        /* +6: number of links to file */
   char  uid;           /* +7: user ID of owner */
   char  gid;           /* +8: group ID of owner */
   char  size0;         /* +9: high byte of 24-bit size */
   int   size1;         /* +10: low word of 24-bit size */
   int   addr[8];       /* +12: block numbers or device number */
   int   actime[2];     /* +28: time of last access */
   int   modtime[2];    /* +32: time of last modification */
};
```

Timestamp known as ctime was first instroduced later in
[version 7](https://github.com/dspinellis/unix-history-repo/blob/Research-V7-Snapshot-Development/usr/sys/h/stat.h) from January 1979.
And right from the beginning it's meaning was the same as we understand it
today, which shows that ctime never used to mean *creation time*.

```
struct	stat
{
	dev_t	st_dev;
	ino_t	st_ino;
	unsigned short st_mode;
	short	st_nlink;
	short  	st_uid;
	short  	st_gid;
	dev_t	st_rdev;
	off_t	st_size;
	time_t	st_atime;
	time_t	st_mtime;
	time_t	st_ctime;
};
```

Timestamps of the stat structure stayed in this form through POSIX
standardization to to the present day (with the already mentioned
exception of nanosecond time precision extension).

&lt;hint&gt;
For some time I used to confuse meaning of mtime (modify) and ctime (change)
so that when I was searching for files by date, I had to look it up every now
and then.
But based on the information presented above, we can come up with a
nice hint to help us remember the difference: ctime is the timestamp sometimes
incorrectly considered to represent *creation time* and which was not
present in almost first 10 years of Unix history. So ctime must be less
important than mtime, and so ctime must describe change in inode file metadata
(which is something I'm not interested in most cases anyway).
&lt;/hint&gt;

It's hard to say when unix timestamp representing *creation time* aka *birth time*
(btime) showed up for the first time, because it's quite likely that it
happened in some proprietary Unix system. And since such systems are now dead,
without publicly available documentation or source code under reasonable
license, I'm not willing to put additional resources and effort into looking up
something like that.
But for Unix like systems with free and open source code, the first place is
clear: timestamp for *creation time* was introduced for the 1st time as late as
in 2003 in [FreeBSD 5.0](https://www.freebsd.org/releases/5.0R/announce.html)
with introduction of
[UFS2](https://www.usenix.org/legacy/events/bsdcon03/tech/full_papers/mckusick/mckusick_html/)
filesystem. And from there it spread to other BSD systems, such as
[NetBSD](http://cvsweb.netbsd.org/bsdweb.cgi/src/sys/sys/stat.h?rev=1.42&content-type=text/x-cvsweb-markup&only_with_tag=MAIN)
or
[OpenBSD](https://github.com/openbsd/src/commit/cc2fc615c6e2dee87e5a3cd5a655a2ee5ef778c8).

It's worth noticing how the FreeBSD developers added the *birth time* support.
Since there was enough unused space in stat structure of FreeBSD,
[adding new timestamp under name `st_birthtime` into stat struct](https://github.com/dspinellis/unix-history-repo/blob/FreeBSD-release/5.0.0/sys/sys/stat.h)
wasn't a problem from the compatibility perspective. [Right now the timestamp
is called
`st_birthtim`](https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=stat&apropos=0&sektion=2&manpath=FreeBSD+13-current&arch=default&format=html),
so that it's meaning and name match convention from the current POSIX standard
(see the table above).

[OpenSolaris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenSolaris) provides support
for creation time as well, but it's developers have avoided any changes in stat
structure. To get a btime value it's necessary to use
[fgetattr(3C)](https://www.unix.com/man-page/opensolaris/3C/fsetattr/) call
and from the list of returned attributes read `A_CRTIME`.
This implementation seems to be already present in the very 1st public commit
of OpenSolaris project from 2005, so it likely comes from Solaris.

I don't know whether anyone is considering adding btime into POSIX standard, I
failed to find any information about that. My guess is that that nobody cares
nowadays.

## Birth time support in Linux filesystems

Like other Unix kernels, Linux hasn't supported btime for a long time.
Ext3 or reiserfs filesystems don't store btime for it's files and
[`stat(2)`](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/stat.2.html) syscall
returns structure of the same name without this timestamp as well.
[Birth time support in Linux has been talked about for quite some
time](https://www.redhat.com/archives/ext3-users/2006-October/msg00015.html),
but compared to FreeBSD it wasn't possible to simply add the new timestamp
into free padding space of existing `stat` structure, because Linux doesn't
offer enough free space there.
More viable option turned out to be [adding btime into proposed new `xstat()`
syscall, but merging of this syscall got unfortunately stuck for some
time](https://lwn.net/Articles/397442/).

Nevertheless Linux developers started to introduce btime support into new
filesystems well before the consensus about `xstat()` was reached.
For example [ext4 received btime support in 2007 as a part of a patch
implementing nanosecond timestamp
resolution](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=ef7f38359ea8b3e9c7f2cae9a4d4935f55ca9e80)
(disk format of ext4 is stable since [kernel
2.6.28](https://kernelnewbies.org/Linux_2_6_28) from December 2008).
[Btrfs got it in 2012](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=9cc97d646216b6f2473fa4ab9f103514b86c6814),
while it's disk format is stable [since about November 2013](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=4204617d142c0887e45fda2562cb5c58097b918e).
XFS, which originally didn't implement btime, [received the support as part of
a change adding metadata checksums in
2013](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=93848a999cf9b9e4f4f77dba843a48c393f33c59)
and so it's available since [kernel 3.10](https://kernelnewbies.org/Linux_3.10#XFS_metadata_checksums).
This means that even on a quite old distro, a filesystem likely already stores
btime of every file, even though this information is not directly available
for users to see. Without a kernel support, one can only get to this
information using filesystem debugging tools, which are unique for each
filesystem, and which obviously require root privileges and direct access to a
block device with the filesystem.

### How to read btime value with fs debug tools

First of all, let's create new partitions to play with:

~~~
# mkfs.ext4 /dev/vdc
# mount /dev/vdc /mnt/test_ext4
# echo "ext4" > /mnt/test_ext4/testfile
~~~

~~~
# mkfs.xfs /dev/vdd
# mount /dev/vdd /mnt/test_xfs
# echo "xfs" > /mnt/test_xfs/testfile
~~~

For the record: I used a machine running Debian Stretch (current stable) for
this demonstration to be more realistic. That is because Stretch already
contains kernel with btime support for both ext4 and XFS, but at the same time
it can't yet pass btime values into user space. The procedure shown below would
work on more modern distros as well, but when you already have an option to get
btime value via syscall directly, it doesn't make sense to do it the hard
way. I would have covered btrfs as well, but I was unable to figure out how to
get btime value out of it in a similar way.

To deal with ext4 filesystem we are going to use
[`debugfs`](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/debugfs.8.html) and it's
`stat` command, which reports file birth time as `crtime`:

~~~ {.kod}

~~~

For a file stored on XFS volume we will need `xfs_db` instead.
But first of all we
need to find out inode of the file we are interested in and then either umount
the filesystem, or alternatively we can just remount it in a read only mode.
In xfs db output, the creation timestamp is listed as `v3.crtime.sec` and
``v3.crtime.nsec``:

~~~
# ls -i /mnt/test_xfs/testfile
99 /mnt/test_xfs/testfile

~~~

Note that if you try use command `stat -v` from `xfs_io` instead, btime value
won't be shown:

~~~

# TZ=CET xfs_io -r /mnt/test_xfs/testfile -c 'stat -v'

fsxattr.naextents = 0
dioattr.mem = 0x200
dioattr.miniosz = 512
dioattr.maxiosz = 2147483136
~~~

Another possible pitfall with XFS is that [XFS btime support is not available
in RHEL 7](https://blog.fpmurphy.com/2014/06/rhel7-xfs-is-a-step-backwards-forensically.html), since as we just noted, XFS can handle btime since kernel 3.10.

And obviously even if you mount XFS volume on a system running kernel with
btime support, it would not matter if the filesystem itself was created using
an older format which doesn't support it. This applies to all filesystems
which haven't originally implemented btime.

### Reading btime from Linux ext4 volume on a FreeBSD

Funny thing is that when you create ext4 filesystem volume on Linux, and then
mount it on a FreeBSD machine,
you will be able to read btime values of files stored there
using native FreeBSD `stat` command. This works despite the fact that FreeBSD
obviously provides only limited support for Linux filesystems, e.g. ext4 volume
can be mounted via
[`ext2fs`](https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=ext2fs&apropos=0&sektion=5&manpath=FreeBSD+12.0-RELEASE+and+Ports&arch=default&format=html)
in read only mode only (there is an option to use FUSE implementation instead
which can handle read write mode, but I haven't tried that).

This is what happens when we try to read btime on ext4 volume from the
previous example on FreeBSD 12. Timestamps in the output are listed in the
following order: atime, mtime, ctime and btime.

~~~
# mount -t ext2fs -o ro /dev/vtbd1 /mnt/test_ext4
# cat /mnt/test_ext4/testfile
ext4
# env TZ=CET stat /mnt/test_ext4/testfile
92 12 -rw-r--r-- 1 root wheel 127754 5 "Feb 15 15:00:32 2019" "Feb 15 15:00:14 2019" "Feb 15 15:00:14 2019" "Feb 15 15:00:14 2019" 4096 8 0 /mnt/test_ext4/testfile
~~~

## Birth time support in GNU Linux distributions

So far we have covered support of btime timestamp in Linux filesystems.
But for this to be useful, we need to be able to pass this information from
kernel to user space. And as I have already noted above, [the original plan was
that btime value would be available via `xstat()` syscall, but then merging
of this syscall got stuck](https://lwn.net/Articles/397442/), and then
[after few years it appeared again in a different form as
`statx()`](https://lwn.net/Articles/685791/), which was eventually merged in
[Linux kernel
4.11](https://kernelnewbies.org/Linux_4.11#statx.282.29.2C_a_modern_stat.282.29_alternative)
from April 2017.
[GNU C Library supports
btime](https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=21297) since
[glibc 2.28](https://www.sourceware.org/ml/libc-alpha/2018-08/msg00003.html)
from August 2018. Which means that we can try this out already eg. with
Fedora 29.

The following code demonstrates how to use
[`statx(2)`](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/statx.2.html) to
read a btime value for given file.
The fact that we can specify which metadata we are interested in makes it
possible for kernel to avoid fetching values which we won't plan to use. This
is by the way one of the selling points of `statx(2)` compared to `stat(2)`.

``` c
#define _GNU_SOURCE

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <sys/stat.h>
#include <fcntl.h>

int main(int argc, char**argv)
{
	struct statx stx = { 0, };
	if (argc != 2) {
		printf("Usage: %s FILE\n", argv[0]);
		printf("Display btime of a given file in UNIX time format.\n");
		return EXIT_SUCCESS;
	}
	int rc = statx(AT_FDCWD, argv[1], AT_SYMLINK_NOFOLLOW, STATX_BTIME, &stx);
	if (rc == 0) {
		if (stx.stx_btime.tv_sec != 0) {
			printf("@%u.%u\n", stx.stx_btime.tv_sec, stx.stx_btime.tv_nsec);
		} else {
			printf("-\n");
		}
	} else {
		perror("statx");
	}
	return rc;
}
```

If you use a distro with Linux kernel 4.11 or later, but still with glibc
version older than 2.28, you will have to call `statx(2)` via `syscall(2)`
instead.

The program reports sheer timestamp value in unix epoch format. The leading at
sign is just a hack to make it straightforward for `date` tool to decode it's
value:

```
$ make btime
cc     btime.c   -o btime
$ ./btime btime
@1550254543.238843517
$ ./btime btime | date -f- --rfc-3339=ns

When we mount the ext4 volume from previous experiments, we will get
expected result:

```
$ ./btime /mnt/test_ext4/testfile | date -f- --rfc-3339=ns

### Stat from GNU Coreutils

As I noted in the beginning, `stat(1)` command from GNU Coreutils reports
btime as "-". We may wonder why the stat tool bothers with this at all, because
until recently, Linux kernel didn't provide any way to get this information.
That said a closer look reveals that
[gnulib](https://www.gnu.org/software/gnulib/), which is used by GNU stat to
read values from stat struct, was [enhanced with btime support thanks to BSD
systems back in
2007](http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/gnulib.git/commit/?id=735c00a2f3a5ce7aaec8517f5438ce37b48a936c).
And that [btime related code was introduced into `stat(1)` in
2010](https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/coreutils.git/commit/?id=abe5c1f9bc09753fd79e7a121c8ecfa917dfaddb).
I guess that it was somehow related to the `xstat(2)` syscall effort, which
failed to be merged into the kernel in the end.
In any case, thanks to all this, since [GNU Coreutils 8.6 from 2010](https://savannah.gnu.org/forum/forum.php?forum_id=6553),
`stat(1)` reports btime as "-" in all cases no matter what filesystem is
involved when executed on Linux, while eg. on BSD systems or Solaris it can
actually report birth time value as long as the filesystem supports it.

Further look at the coreutils source code reveals that thanks to a hack
implementing btime support for Solaris, it's not that hard to add
Linux btime support using `statx(2)` syscall in a similar way:

``` diff

+    }
+#endif
+
   return ts;
 }
```

The idea behind this hack is that stat calls classic `stat(2)` syscall to get
file metadata as before, but then it also uses `statx(2)` to get just
btime. This is good enough for us to start playing with this feature:

```
$ touch ~/tmp/test
$ ./stat ~/tmp/test
  File: /home/martin/tmp/test
  Size: 0               Blocks: 0          IO Block: 4096   regular empty file

```

That said this solution is obviously not optimal, as it uses 2 syscalls
instead of just one. And needless to say it's not utilizing possibilities of
`statx(2)` syscall design. So far I haven't tried to come up with
a more polished patch, and based on the fact that nobody replied to [my
coreutils list
message](https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/coreutils/2018-12/msg00016.html),
my guess is that nobody is actively working on it right now.

### Stat from GNU Bash

I got a bit worried when I was reading [release notes of Bash
5.0](https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bash-announce/2019-01/msg00000.html)
from January 2019, which introduces:

> d. New loadable builtins: rm, stat, fdflags.

At first I was thinking that adding btime support into stat from GNU coreutils
won't be enough, as since bash 5.0, most users will be working with stat
implemented as a [shell builtin](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Shell-Builtin-Commands.html),
in a similar way bash users mostly work with bash implementation of `time`
instead of `/bin/time` command line tool:

```
$ type -a time
time is a shell keyword
time is /usr/bin/time
time is /bin/time
```

But it turned out that this is not the case, because it's so called [*dynamic
loadable
builtin*](http://www.drdobbs.com/shell-corner-bash-dynamically-loadable-b/199102950).
The [source code of bash implementation of
stat](http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/bash.git/tree/examples/loadables/stat.c)
is located in
[`examples/loadables/`](http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/bash.git/tree/examples/loadables)
directory, and builtins placed there (such as `cat.c` or `sleep.c`) are not
available in binary packages of bash (which you can check for
yourself when you inspect output of `enable -a` command). The idea behind this
is that when you need to optimize a shell script, which is eg. using sleep
in a loop, you can compile corresponding builtin (or write your own) and load
it into bash via `enable -f`. Personally I would rather use pyton in such
cases, but if you can't avoid bash (eg. because it's some big legacy script),
the option is there.

And as I indicated above, bash builtin implementation of `stat` doesn't read
btime values:

```
$ enable -f ~/projects/bash/examples/loadables/stat stat
$ help stat
stat: stat [-lL] [-A aname] file
    Load an associative array with file status information.

    Take a filename and load the status information returned by a
    stat(2) call on that file into the associative array specified
    by the -A option.  The default array name is STAT.  If the -L
    option is supplied, stat does not resolve symbolic links and
    reports information about the link itself.  The -l option results
    in longer-form listings for some of the fields. The exit status is 0
    unless the stat fails or assigning the array is unsuccessful.
$ stat ~/tmp/test
$ for i in "${!STAT[@]}"; do echo $i = ${STAT[$i]}; done
nlink = 1
link = /home/martin/tmp/test
perms = 0664
inode = 7377267
blksize = 4096
device = 64775
atime = 1550256766
type = -
blocks = 0
uid = 1000
size = 0
rdev = 0
name = /home/martin/tmp/test
mtime = 1550256766
ctime = 1550256766
gid = 1000
```

But in this case it seems to me that instead of adding btime support into this
`stat` builtin function, it would be better to write another one, which would
be able to fully take advantage of new `statx(2)` syscall.

### Other tools

Unfortunately btime support in base components of GNU Linux distributions
still doesn't go beyond `statx(2)` wrapper in glibc.
Like above mentioned `stat` implementations, no basic tool such as `ls` or
`find` can work with btime on Linux right now.
As in the case of `stat` tool, some of these tools already have some btime
related functionality, e.g.`find` can already search files by btime,
it only lacks a way to read btime value on Linux.
On the other hand since btime value is available only via new `statx(2)`
syscall, changes in these tools may not be always as straightforward as one
could assume at first.

It will also depend on whether it will be possible to change btime via
syscalls such as
[`utimes(2)`](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/utimes.2.html) or
[`utimensat(2)`](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/utimensat.2.html).
Right now, it's not possible to change btime of a file. On one hand it makes
sense, birth time doesn't change later by definition but on the other hand it
also means that we can't archive file including it's btime value via `cp -a`
nor restore it from backup via rsync.
Because of this, implementation of btime handling in GNU tar will likely take
bit longer, as it's not clear why would anyone implement btime handling there,
when this information can't be restored on Linux during archive extraction.

At this point it's worth pointing out that FreeBSD provides a way to change
btime of a file via
[`utimes(2)`](https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=utimes&apropos=0&sektion=2&manpath=FreeBSD+12.0-RELEASE&arch=default&format=html)
from the beginning, as explained in original
[UFS2 design paper](https://www.usenix.org/legacy/events/bsdcon03/tech/full_papers/mckusick/mckusick_html/).

## What does btime actually mean and what it can be used for?

What does a birth time of a file actually mean? It looks like the answer is
clear, but it's not that simple. It's a low level information about a file.
Kernel assigns it when a file is created, and doesn't provide any way to change
it later. That said you will easily lose this information eg. when you copy
a file, no matter if you try to preserve file attributes, since from the kernel
perspective, it's a new file and btime can't be changed.
Another common use case when you lose btime is when [an application renames a
temporary file overwriting existing file to perform atomic
write](https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/45812/58336).

Btw it haven't occurred to me before that such atomic rename operation is done
by vim every time you write to a file (note the change of inode and birth time
of the file):

```
$ rm ~/tmp/test
$ touch ~/tmp/test
$ stat.hacked ~/tmp/test
  File: /home/martin/tmp/test
  Size: 0         	Blocks: 0          IO Block: 4096   regular empty file
Device: fd07h/64775d	Inode: 7377286     Links: 1
Access: (0664/-rw-rw-r--)  Uid: ( 1000/  martin)   Gid: ( 1000/  martin)

 Birth: 2019-02-17 09:52:17.151767057 +0100
```

And this finally brings us to the question: What is btime actually good for?
Judging from the time it took for complete btime support to reach Linux kernel,
nobody seems to give it a high priority.
This is also apparent from fact that btime related changes often appear in
larger commits whose main purpose is dealing with something else.
For example ext4 introduced btime in a patch implementing nanosecond
timestamps. Similarly XFS added btime as part of adding metadata checksums
and `statx(2)` syscall wasn't designed just to read btime.
And last but not least, during the whole 50 year long unix history, nobody
suggested to have it included in POSIX standard.

When we look at the reasons for btime implementation in Linux, besides sheer
"UFS2/ZFS has it as well" we often see references to Samba and Windows
compatibility.
Unfortunately Samba can't directly take advantage of Linux btime, since Windows
allows birth time of a file to be changed.
And while [NTFS-3G](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NTFS-3G) could use Linux
btime to report birth time of NTFS files, nobody will work on this until there
is `statx(2)` support available in FUSE and at least all coreutils tools are
be able to work with btime.
Moreover [NTFS-3G can already report birth time on Linux via extended
attributes](https://www.tuxera.com/community/ntfs-3g-advanced/extended-attributes/#filetimes), although using just `ls` would certainly be more convenient.

In any case the new timestamp can be used for debugging of a strange
behaviour, when every pice of additional evidence is useful no matter if the
problem is caused by an attacker, malware or a bug.
Besides these "forensic" cases, btime could be used for the opposite purposes
as well.
For example [one could try to hide a small amount of data in the
timestamp](https://www.dfrws.org/sites/default/files/session-files/paper_anti-forensics_in_ext4_on_secrecy_and_usability_of_timestamp-based_data_hiding.pdf).
Paradoxically the current status quo (btime support implemented only in
Linux kernel) is actually good for both cases.
Forensic analysis benefits from the fact that a less known timestamp is less
likely to be falsified.
And the opposite use cases can take advantage of the fact that btime misuse
is not directly visible.
