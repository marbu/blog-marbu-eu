When I was reading book [How the Web was
Born](https://books.google.com/books/about/How_the_Web_was_Born.html?id=pIH-JijUNS0C)
(which describes the history of networking, user interfaces, hypertext and other
computing concepts which the world wide web is based on), I realized how
different the first web browser as designed by [Tim
Berners-Lee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee) was compared to
both browsers which came right after it as well as to modern ones we are all
using nowadays. In this post I will focus on development and use cases of
early web browsers explaining why they differ so much both between
each other and modern browsers highlighting connections between the original
vision and current reality.

Until I red the book, I had only very limited idea how the first browser
created in 1990 actually worked. I knew that the browser was implemented on a
[NeXT computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeXT_Computer) and I was familiar
with it's interface from few screenshots like the one shown below.
Moreover as a former [Window
Maker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Window_Maker) user, I had some basic
understanding of the nature of
[NeXTSTEP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeXTSTEP) GUI. But I have never tried
to look deeper than that before.

![A [screenshot of WorldWideWeb HyperMedia Browser/Editor](https://cds.cern.ch/record/1164397)

So when I started to read about it in the book, I quickly realized that the
original design and it's role in the history of the web is quite interesting,
and it prompted me to look up more details later.

## Looking at the original design

Unlike the modern browsers, the WorldWideWeb (as it
was called back then) was both a reader and an editor. It was
meant to allow users to create web pages as easily as they were able to read
them. To achieve this, Tim Berners-Lee build it's graphical
interface on top of NeXTSTEP text processor GUI component, so that one can
easily edit anything on any web page in WYSIWYG fashion.
So from implementation perspective, this browser was web page editor also
optimized for sheer reading. Changes in local files could be directly saved,
while for remote pages served
over http or ftp, you could at least save your changes into a local copy
instead. Remote editing was not an option since there was no support for it in
the protocol. [HTTP `PUT`
method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/PUT) was
proposed and then standardized much later.

The [NeXTSTEP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeXTSTEP) platform, especially
it's [object
oriented](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming) nature and
[Interface
Builder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface_Builder#History), was crucial
for this design to be implemented quickly, [as Tim Berners-Lee
explains](https://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/WorldWideWeb.html):

> There was an application builder to make all the menus as quickly as you
> could dream them up. There were all the software parts to make a wysiwyg
> (what you see is what you get - in other words direct manipulation of text on
> screen as on the printed - or browsed page) word processor. I just had to add
> hypertext, (by subclassing the Text object).

Looking at the screenshot above, you are likely wondering how would one edit a
page? When one clicked anywhere within a web page, a cursor was inserted there
and then one was able to start typing new text, remove existing text or
navigate within the text. One can also select block of text using mouse and
perform some action on it, such as simple deletion, creating a link or further
formatting. These editing functions were available via a menu.

![demonstration of editing in WorldWideWeb](/images/www-editing.gif) \

For further context, see a [video demonstration of editing and
linking](https://worldwideweb.cern.ch/images/howto/links.mp4) from [CERN 2019
WorldWideWeb Rebuild](https://worldwideweb.cern.ch/) project, which provides
[javascript reimplementation of the first browser
UX](https://worldwideweb.cern.ch/browser) along with explanations of
it's features, so that you can also try it yourself. I used it to record the
editing demonstration above.
That said if you are using Firefox note that it's unfortunately optimized for
[Blink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blink_(browser_engine)) based browsers
such as Chrome, and some features like editing work only in such browsers.

This editor/reader design influenced other parts of the browser as well. For
example there was no bookmarking feature. However that wasn't because Tim
Berners-Lee didn't anticipate users to collect and manage links to other web
pages. Users were expected to maintain links for future reference on their
own local web pages instead. This is also where the original concept of
[home page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_page) comes from. The home page
was as it is now the first page shown when the browser starts, but unlike
today, one could create and edit it's own home page directly in the browser
easily.

Another interesting detail is that when you double clicked on a link (single
click was used for editing as we noted above), new window with
the target page was opened. You leave a page only when you explicitly closed
it's window. It was not possible to open a different page in existing window.

It was also not possible to include images directly into a web page. Instead
images were referenced via links as any other documents, so when one opened
such link, the image was shown in a new window. This
allowed a reader to inspect the image while still reading the original page,
possibly scrolling down without the image to disappear with the text. The
[img element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img)
was introduced later in 1993.

Surprisingly there was no [URL bar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_bar).
To open particular web page using it's URL, one would use [*Open from full
document reference*
dialog](https://worldwideweb.cern.ch/images/howto/openurl_small.mp4) instead.
This design is similar to how [word
processors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_processor) such as
[LibreOffice Writer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:LibreOffice_Writer_7.1.2_(released_in_2021-04,_running_on_Linux_and_GNOME_with_the_default_icon_set).png)
work: there is no file path bar either, but but one can go to *open file*
dialog and select or type path of a file.

And last but not least when I played with the 2019 UX rebuild, I noticed that
it was not possible to change width of a page window. This seems to be yet
another behaviour which was likely based on a word processor interface. That
said here I'm not 100% sure as I was unable to find any explicit reference to
this.

## (Un)expected familiarity

The idea that people will be creating their own web pages directly in the
browser to keep track of their projects and to collaborate with others
failed to materialize as originally envisaged. That said a similar
outcome was later achieved in a different way via various web based content
management systems, which are build on top of the open web standards rather
than being direct part of it. This difference may feel subtle, but it has major
consequences, both good and bad.

When I tried [the javascript reimplementation of
WordWideWeb](https://worldwideweb.cern.ch/browser)
and learned it's editing functionality a bit, it sometimes felt like a
bare-bones version of Google docs and vice versa editing a Google docs
document using only core features reminded me a bit of the WorldWideWeb UX.
I wonder how many people using modern cloud document collaboration platforms
would be surprised to learn that some core parts of this use case were covered
in the original vision for the web.
That said I personally I find Google docs too paper like and I don't like the
fact that it tries to keep you confined in it's closed ecosystem.

I also realized that my local
[personal wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_wiki) workflow is
somewhat
close to the original concept of user maintained local pages
(ignoring the fact that my wiki doesn't have
WYSIWYG editing mode). This wiki is set as my home page, so that I'm able to
easily edit or create new pages. So for example for some areas of
interest, I maintain a wikipage with list of links and some additional notes,
rather than using browser provided bookmarks.

![example of a page from my personal wiki](/images/personal-wiki-example.png) \

Moreover concept of user created homepage is not entirely lost, even though
maintenance cost and purpose of start pages presented in
[r/startpages](https://www.reddit.com/r/startpages/) subreddit is different.

I also like the concept of opening images in a separate window, so that I can
continue reading a page while still being able to inspect an image. This
approach is unfortunately not popular nor easily available for some reason.
Both Firefox and Chromium allows to easily open given image in new tab, but not
in a new window, which is available only for links. Even worse is that some web
platforms provide images via javascript image galleries, which can't be easily
opened in a new window. On the other hand, similar feature for videos under
name [Picture-in-Picture](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/about-picture-picture-firefox)
was introduced some time ago, so I wonder why not to have something similar for
images as well.

And last but not least it's interesting that something so fundamental as URL
bar that [proposals to remove or simplify it creates lot of
backlash](https://www.androidpolice.com/2020/06/15/google-confirms-experiment-to-remove-full-address-from-url-bar-in-chrome-details-opt-out-mechanism/)
was not even present in the original design. That said one is not expected to
narrow down every detail in a first prototype.

## Kickstarting the idea

While the NeXT computer platform was crucial for quick development of the first
web browser/editor prototype, the platform also had a significant downside in
small user base. Even at CERN during the early stage of the web project,
WorldWideWeb had 2 actual users only: Tim Berners-Lee and [Robert
Cailliau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Cailliau), who were also the
only people working on the web fulltime back then.
But for the web to succeed, it was necessary to have a client software
available on all major platforms, including PC (MS DOS/Windows), Mac and Unix
[X window](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Window_System).
Sheer porting WorldWideWeb to other platforms was out of question.

For this reason, the next web client software, implemented in 1991 by [Nicola
Pellow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicola_Pellow) during her internship at
CERN and named [Line Mode
Browser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_Mode_Browser), provided a simple
read only text interface so that it could be compiled and used on almost any
platform including "dumb terminals" (it didn't even use [curses
library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curses_(programming_library)), unlike
text browsers I'm familiar with today). To navigate links with keyboard only
input, each link had displayed a unique number next to it and one had to type
this number down to proceed to it's target page. Compared to the first
browser/editor it was very limited, but it was the first browser most people
could actually use on computers they had access to.

[Oct-Dec 1991 issue of CERN COMPUTER
NEWSLETTER](https://cdsweb.cern.ch/record/1292517/files/n-204.pdf) by Tim
Berners-Lee, Robert Cailliau, [Jean-Francois
Groff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Fran%C3%A7ois_Groff) and Bernd Pollermann.
Assuming [CERN Conditions of Use](http://copyright.cern.ch/).
](/images/line_mode_browser.png)

But having nice simple browser compatible with almost every computer platform
would not drive adoption of the web nor help CERN with information
management problem if there were no useful information available there.
Understanding this opportunity [Bernd Pollermann](https://www.legalanthology.ch/pollermann_bernd/)
created so called [XFIND Gateway](https://www.w3.org/Talks/FINDGateway.html)
which provided information from CERN XFIND information system via web.
This may not sound like much, but it was actually extremely useful for
physicists using various CERN information systems.
[The book](https://books.google.com/books/about/How_the_Web_was_Born.html?id=pIH-JijUNS0C)
gives an example of a physicist from German particle physics lab
[DESY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DESY) who get used to look up information
via XFIND at CERN, but using it from DESY was bit clumsy. First of all he had
to telnet to CERN, then login to IBM CERNVM machine, then start XFIND there and
then finally place his query to XFIND. Moreover as the connection was slow an
unstable, one have to repeat this procedure again in case of a network failure.
Compared to this using Line Mode Browser from DESY to directly access XFIND
Gateway at CERN was a big improvement, which helped the web to spread to DESY.

The following diagram shows overview of the web ecosystem in 1992, but note
that during early stages of the web (in the end of 1990), WorldWideWeb
browser/editor (NeXT), Line mode browser (dumb) and FIND gateway were already
in demonstrable state. Then during following year 1991 first version of Line
mode browser was released and another web gateways were deployed for
[VMS/HELP](http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/VMSHelp/Overview.html) and
[WAIS](http://ksi.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/archives/WWW-TALK/www-talk-1991.messages/8.html)
information systems.
This means that most of the information available on the web were provided via
these *gateways* from other systems in an uniform way. Moreover this
unification was another important selling point of the web.

![Diagram from [an article titled *World Wide Web* (1992)](https://cds.cern.ch/record/234628) by Tim Berners-Lee, Robert Cailliau and Jean-Francois Groff. Assuming [CERN Conditions of Use](http://copyright.cern.ch/).](/images/WorldWideWeb.png)

So we already see that there was a big difference in functionality and use
cases between the original WorldWideWeb browser/editor prototype and first
actually widely used Line Mode Browser. The latter was missing lot of features
from the former, but even in this limited text based read-only form it was
already very useful.

From the diagram above it's obvious that the plan was to eventually create
more powerful web client for each platform. And even though in 1992 Robert
Cailliau and Nicola Pellow started working on
[MacWWW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacWWW) (aka Samba) which
was a simple browser for Macintosh computers, Tim quickly realized that CERN
won't give them enough resources to implement nor maintain browsers for all
the platforms. So instead he decided to focus on
[libwww](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libwww)
library covering core functionality of a web browser, which can be used by
others outside CERN to build their own browsers on different platforms.
This resulted in wave of new browsers released in 1992 such as
[Erwise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erwise),
[ViolaWWW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ViolaWWW),
[MidasWWW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MidasWWW) or
[Lynx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynx_(web_browser)). With exception of
Erwise, which was a short lived student project, authors of these early
browsers used libwww to add web viewing functionality into established
software projects. This also meant that each of these browsers provided some
unique features. Later on in 1993
[NCSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Center_for_Supercomputing_Applications)
released
[Mosaic browser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosaic_(web_browser)), which
was a proprietary graphical browser build on top of libww. Mosaic quickly
become the most popular browser until
[Netscape Navigator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netscape_Navigator) took
over it in 1995.

Here it's worth noting that libwww (along with the server and line mode browser
code) [was released in public
domain](https://home.cern/science/computing/birth-web/licensing-web), even
though that Tim originally considered GPL. That is because he was more
interested in kickstarting the idea of open web as a protocol and open standard
rather than particular server or client software implementation.

## Conclusion

Overall I find it impressive how Tim Berners-Lee, Robert Cailliau and other
[early web people](http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/People.html) were able to
combine both crazy moonshot ideas with pragmatism and execution, which combined
together made the project successful.

Now I also better understand motivation behind various web editing features
standardized over the years, such as `PUT` or `DELETE` methods or
[WebDAV extensions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebDAV). Both of these
standards are nowadays commonly used in web APIs (REST, CalDAV, ...) but almost
nobody uses them to edit resources as originaly envisaged. And while
I understand that Tim regrets that his original vision didn't fully take off,
I'm not really sure he could have done a better job to promote it without
sacrificing decisive growth of the web in the early stage of the
project since as we have seen, collaborative editing was not a driving force
behind the early web adoption.
