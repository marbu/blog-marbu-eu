Hello! My name is **Martin Bukatoviƒç** and this is my personal blog.

## About me

I'm a Python developer, tester and Linux admin.
Currently I'm working at [Red Hat](https://www.redhat.com/en) as a quality
engineer on [Azure Red Hat
OpenShift](https://docs.openshift.com/aro/4/welcome/index.html)
project.

## About the blog

I write about whatever I find interesting, mostly related (but not limited) to
technology, programming and free and open source software in general.

Opinions presented here in this blog are my own and doesn't represent neither
