Hello, my name is **Martin Bukatoviƒç** and this is my personal blog.

## About me

I'm a Python developer and long time Linux user with admin experience.
I work at *Red Hat*, where I test and analyze problems with distributed
storage clusters based on kubernetes, rook and ceph.

## About the blog

Every now and then I publish a post about a topic I find worth looking into.
It can be something interesting I'm dealing with, or a simple
demonstration for a friend or colleague, polished for a wider audience.

Opinions presented here in this blog are my own and doesn't represent neither
company I work for nor any open source project I'm involved with.
