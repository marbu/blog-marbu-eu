Hello, my name is **Martin Bukatoviƒç** and this is my personal blog.

## About me

I'm a Python developer and long time Linux user with admin experience.
I work at *Red Hat*, where I test and analyze problems with distributed
storage clusters based on kubernetes, rook and ceph.

## About the blog

Every now and then I run into something interesting enough for me to write
about. It could be someting I have some experience with, a topic I find
fascinating and worth learning about or just a simple demonstration for a
friend or colleague, polished for a wider audience. Most of the posts deals
with technology, programming, GNU/Linux systems and open source software in
genral.

Opinions presented here in this blog are my own and doesn't represent neither
company I work for nor any open source project I'm involved with.
